		<h2>Venus flytrap</h2>

		<p>The Venus flytrap is a flowering plant best known for its carnivorous eating habits. The “trap” is made of two hinged lobes at the end of each leaf. On the inner surfaces of the lobes are hair-like projections called trichomes that cause the lobes to snap shut when prey comes in contact with them. This type of movement is called thigmonasty—a nondirectional plant response to being touched. To prevent the plant from wasting energy if prey isn’t actually there, the trap will only shut when the trichomes are touched multiple times. The hinged traps are edged with small bristles that interlock when the trap shuts to ensure the prey can’t squirm out. There are other carnivorous plants in the wild, but the Venus flytrap is one of the very few that exhibits motion to actively trap its prey.<br />
		The Venus flytrap gets some of its nutrients from the soil, but to supplement its diet, the plant eats insects and arachnids. Ants, beetles, grasshoppers, flying insects, and spiders are all victims of the flytrap. It can take a Venus flytrap three to five days to digest an organism, and it may go months between meals.</p>

		<h2>Nepenthes villosa</h2> 
		<img src="Nepenthes_villosa.jpg" alt="Nepenthes villosa">
		<p> Nepenthes villosa may be the most bizzarrely beautiful plant in the world.  It grows only in the upper montane forests of a few ultramaffic regions in Kinabalu National Park where it produces large amounts of pitchers as it scrambles across the dwarfed brush just below the treeline. It can be challenging to give Nepenthes villosa the conditions it wants to thrive but if you are able to do so then the species itself is not too finicky.  Don't be misled by growers who try to convince you this plant can be grown as anything other than a strict highland plant.  It can survive for a few months in non-ideal conditions; however, if a young plant starts going downhill it may be very difficult to get it to recover.  Ideally, villosa wants nights in the low to mid 50's and days in the 70's with high humidity.  Villosa is prone to crown rot especially when young so the leaves must be kept dry.  The soil mix is not crucial (we use our typical Nepenthes mix) but make sure it has good drainage or the roots may suffer.  In villosa's natural habitat (around 2600-3200 meters elevation) nights often can drop to just above freezing.    Villosa prefers average light to slightly higher light than most Nepenthes.  We've found that it produces its best pitchers in the spring (fingers crossed we get a flower soon since our biggest plant is now vining).  Once established, villosa is a steady grower and will produce a few long lasting pitchers per year.</p>

	<h2> Sundew </h2>
	<img src="Sundew.webp" alt="sundew">
		 <p> Genus of approximately 152 carnivorous plant species in the family Droseraceae. Sundews are widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions, especially in Australia, and are common in bogs and fens with sandy acidic soil. Carnivory does not provide sundews with energy but rather supplies nutrients, particularly nitrogen, in poor soil conditions. <br /> Predominantly perennials, the plants feature small, nodding, five-petaled white or pinkish flowers that are borne on one side of a curving stem some 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) above the basal leaves. The leaves are usually arranged in a rosette and are less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter. The upper surface is covered with flexible gland-tipped trichomes (plant hairs) that exude a sticky substance to attract and entrap insects and other small prey. Trapped prey are engulfed in a web of the sticky glands, colloquially known as tentacles, and digested by enzymes. Following digestion, the leaf unfurls to reset the trap.</p>
